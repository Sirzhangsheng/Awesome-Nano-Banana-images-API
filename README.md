# Nano Banana Images API Integration Instructions

This document introduces the integration and usage of the Nano Banana Images API. This interface supports two capabilities: **image generation (generate)** and **image editing (edit)**.

## Application Process

Before use, please enter the [Nano Banana Images API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/23985a11-d713-41d1-ad84-24b021805b3d) on the Ace Data Cloud platform and click Acquire to apply for activation. The first application usually has free quotas available. Once activated, you can obtain the Bearer Token used to call the API from the platform.

## Interface Overview

- **Base URL**: `https://api.acedata.cloud`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /nano-banana/images`
- **Authentication Method**: Carry `authorization: Bearer {token}` in the HTTP Header
- **Request Headers**:
  - `accept: application/json`
  - `content-type: application/json`
- **Actions**:
  - `generate`: Generate images based on text prompts
  - `edit`: Edit based on given images
- **Asynchronous Callback**: Optional, receive task completion notifications and results via `callback_url`

## Quick Start: Generate Image (`action=generate`)

**Minimum Required Parameters**: `action`, `prompt`
When you only want to generate an image based on a prompt, set `action` to `generate` and provide a clear `prompt`.

### Request Example (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/nano-banana/images' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "action": "generate",
    "prompt": "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay. Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful. Vertical portrait orientation."
  }'
```

### Request Example (Python)

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/nano-banana/images"
headers = {
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
}
payload = {
    "action": "generate",
    "prompt": (
        "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist "
        "with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully "
        "inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched "
        "workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through "
        "a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay. Captured with an 85mm "
        "portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood "
        "is serene and masterful. Vertical portrait orientation."
    ),
}
resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```

### Successful Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "056f0589-a3dd-4ec2-8440-ad61f5038dfa",
  "trace_id": "c48de83f-0077-426e-b02b-ff1d58179064",
  "data": [
    {
      "prompt": "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay.

      "image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/nanobanana/69790adb-c85d-4362-ad9e-0c9ba4352cf4.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Explanation

- `success`: Whether the request was successful.
- `task_id`: Task ID.
- `trace_id`: Trace ID for troubleshooting.
- `data[]`: Result list.
  - `prompt`: The prompt used for generation (echo).
  - `image_url`: Direct URL of the generated image.

> Note: Only `action` and `prompt` are required to generate an image at `/nano-banana/images`.

## Edit Image (`action=edit`)

When you want to edit based on an existing image, set `action` to `edit` and pass the list of image URLs to be edited through `image_urls` (one or more), while also providing a `prompt` describing the editing goal.

For example, if we provide a photo of a person and a photo of a shirt, we can have the person wear that shirt by passing the image URLs and specifying the action as `edit`. The URLs can be HTTP URLs, publicly accessible links using `https` or `http`, or Base64 encoded images, such as `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA+gAAAVGCAMAAAA6u2FyAAADAFBMVEXq6uwdHCEeHyMdHS....`

### Request Example (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/nano-banana/images' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "action": "edit",
    "prompt": "let this man wear on this T-shirt",
    "image_urls": [
      "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/v8073y.png",
      "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/44xlah.png"
    ]
  }'
```

### Request Example (Python)

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/nano-banana/images"
headers = {
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
}
payload = {
    "action": "edit",
    "prompt": "let this man wear on this T-shirt",
    "image_urls": [
        "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/v8073y.png",
        "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/44xlah.png"
    ]
}
resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```

### Successful Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "93f11baf-347b-4bb4-9520-8653cb46d6a3",
  "trace_id": "a9063166-26ed-4451-85b5-54e896817c69",
  "data": [
    {
      "prompt": "let this man wear on this T-shirt",
      "image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/nanobanana/8e9e0253-26f4-45b9-b3f8-ac1aed1c284b.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Explanation

- `image_urls[]`: List of URLs of images to be edited (must be publicly accessible). Multiple images can be passed, and the service will combine these materials with the `prompt` to complete the editing.
- Other fields are the same as the "Generate Image" response.

---

## Asynchronous Callback (Optional, Recommended)

Generation or editing may take some time. To avoid long connections occupying resources, it is recommended to use **Webhook callbacks** via `callback_url`:
1. Add `callback_url` in the request body, for example, your server's Webhook address (must be publicly accessible and support POST JSON).
2. The API will **immediately return** a response containing `task_id` (or basic results).
3. When the task is completed, the platform will send the complete JSON to `callback_url` via `POST`. You can associate the request with the result using `task_id`.

**Callback payload example** (field structure is consistent with synchronous success return):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "6a97bf49-df50-4129-9e46-119aa9fca73c",
  "trace_id": "9b4b1ff3-90f2-470f-b082-1061ec2948cc",
  "data": [
    {
      "prompt": "a white siamese cat",
      "image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/nanobanana/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

When the call fails, a standard error format and trace ID will be returned. Common errors are as follows:

- **400 `token_mismatched`**: The request is illegal or parameters are incorrect.
- **400 `api_not_implemented`**: The interface is not implemented (please contact support).
- **401 `invalid_token`**: Authentication failed or token is missing.
- **429 `too_many_requests`**: Request frequency limit exceeded.
- **500 `api_error`**: Server exception.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "Internal server error."
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```

## Parameter Correspondence and Notes

- **Required**: `action`, `prompt`
- **Edit Only**: `image_urls` (array, at least 1 item)
- **Optional**: `callback_url` (for asynchronous callback)
- **Headers**: Must provide `authorization: Bearer {token}`; `accept` is recommended to be set to `application/json`
- **Image Accessibility**: `image_urls` must be direct links accessible publicly (HTTP/HTTPS), HTTPS is recommended
- **Idempotency and Tracking**: Retain `task_id` and `trace_id` for troubleshooting and result association.
